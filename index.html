                <p>While creating this page, I learned how to trigger events that manipulate elements on an HTML document using JavaScript. To show some of the ways a user can interact with elements on a page, I decided to create a page dedicated to my two cats.</p>

                    <p>The first image here is a photo of my cat, Poots, when he was a kitten. He is 4 years old now. I found him outside my garage crying for food at night. My parents did not want to keep him, but the pet shelter was not accepting any new animals due to overcrowding and the Covid-19 pandemic. We decided to keep him, and now the entire family loves him dearly.</p>

                    <p>The second image here is a current photo of my cat, Farmer. He is 2 years old now. My sister found him dirty and malnourished at a farmers market when she went shopping. We wanted to send him to a shelter or give him to a friend because we didn't think we could take in another cat, but our family got attached quickly. Farmer loves eating just about anything as long as he's able to swallow it. (His favorite food is rice and Bangladeshi beef curry.)</p>
